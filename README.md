This repository presents my learnings on model deployment and software development best practices in the context of machine learning. This project aims to exercise concepts such as testing, model packaging, tooling, etc.

The project comprises the following tools:
- tox
- pytest
- setuptools

For future improvements, I will add docker support and models as API.
